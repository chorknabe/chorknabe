- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chorknabe
- ðŸ‘€I I'm looking for a solution to my problem. I installed Audiveris but it doesn't start. The following message appears:Unrecognized option: -- add-exports=java.desktop/sun.awt.image=ALL-UNNAMED.
Error: Could not create the Virtual Machine.
Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program wants exit.
My Java is in C:\Program Files\Java\jre-1.8\bin\javaw.exe
